# System Design for SDE-1 Interviews

## 🎯 What Companies Actually Ask at SDE-1 Level

### Reality Check

At SDE-1 level, system design is **NOT** about designing YouTube or Netflix at scale.
Companies test if you can **think beyond code** and understand how software systems work.

### What You'll Face

| Company Tier                              | What They Ask                 | Depth Expected              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **FAANG/MAANG**                           | LLD (90%) + Basic HLD (10%)   | Deep LLD, surface HLD       |
| **Unicorns** (Flipkart, Swiggy, Razorpay) | LLD (80%) + Basic HLD (20%)   | Solid LLD, basic HLD        |
| **Mid-tier product** (Atlassian, Intuit)  | LLD (70%) + HLD (30%)         | Good LLD, decent HLD        |
| **Startups**                              | Mostly LLD or "Design an API" | Practical, less theoretical |

### Key Insight

> **SDE-1 = 70-90% LLD, 10-30% Basic HLD**
> Master LLD first. Learn enough HLD to not look clueless.
